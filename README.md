```lrc
[00:18.75] Ok, love you, bye
[00:21.34] I didn't mean to pick a fight
[00:23.10] But, oh well, note to self
[00:25.66] Four pints in, you're someone else
[00:42.66] 
[00:27.87] If you can't see my mirrors
[00:29.91] Then I can't see you
[00:32.19] So don't say you won't forgive me
[00:34.55] 'Cause you always do
[00:36.41] At least you say you do
[00:39.34] It's funny how when it's upside down
[00:44.31] I push through, I just put up with you
[01:03.31] 
[01:07.28] Ok, don't be smart
[01:09.99] Who do you think you are?
[01:11.69] With your earring, walking tall
[01:14.29] Doing your best to make me feel small
[01:32.79] 
[01:16.42] If you can't see my mirrors
[01:18.33] Then I can't see you
[01:20.68] So don't say you won't forgive me
[01:22.75] 'Cause you always do
[01:24.94] At least you say you do
[01:27.80] It's funny how when it's upside down
[01:32.79] I push through, I just put up with you
[01:51.79] 
[01:39.52] Ok, love you, bye
[01:44.19] Ok, love you, bye
[01:48.86] Ok, love you, bye
[01:57.36] 
[01:55.73] Oh well, note to self
[01:57.91] Four pints in, I'm someone else
[02:00.13] But you're no angel, please
[02:02.99] Could you just put up with me?
[02:17.99] 
[02:04.97] If you can't see my mirrors
[02:06.75] Then I can't see you
[02:09.04] So don't say you won't forgive me
[02:11.32] 'Cause you always do
[02:13.55] At least you say you do
[02:16.10] It's funny how when it's upside down
[02:20.98] I push through, I just put up with you
[02:25.06] I just put up with you, I just put up with you
